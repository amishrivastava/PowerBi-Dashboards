# PowerBi-Dashboards
Welcome to my Power BI Dashboard Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my Power BI dashboards, reports, and data visualizations.

## About

In this repository, you will find a variety of Power BI projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling. Each dashboard is designed to provide insights and help make data-driven decisions.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `Protein Cost Barchart`: This data set visualises how much 20 grams of protein costs in various products. The bar chart can be flitered through the slicer to show vegan and vegetarian options.
